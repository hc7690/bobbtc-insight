# BobBTC Insight

BobBTC Insight is a lightweight Bitcoin L1 dashboard built with BOB and OP_NET infrastructure.

## Overview

This project aggregates real-time Bitcoin network data such as:

- BTC price
- Mempool activity
- Basic on-chain metrics
- Network status insights

The goal is to demonstrate how useful tools can be built on Bitcoin Layer 1 using BOB, while making ecosystem data more accessible to builders and users.

## Why It Matters

Bitcoin L1 is evolving beyond simple transactions. With OP_NET and BOB, developers can build real applications directly connected to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

BobBTC Insight serves as a simple but practical example of:

- Open-source vibecoding
- Bitcoin-native tooling
- Transparent builder infrastructure

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Public Bitcoin APIs
- BOB / OP_NET ecosystem
